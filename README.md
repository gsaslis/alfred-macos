# Alfred Snippets and Workflows by gsaslis 

Productivity Boosts and Time-Savers for Alfredapp.com on MacOS: Snippets, Workflows, etc. 

NOTE: Snippets and Workflows are part of the **premium** Alfred features including in the [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/). 
(Money well spent, if you ask me.) 

## Snippets 

Snippets offer a quick way to paste text through the Alfred clipboard manager. 

### Acronyms

Acronyms are a pain (because others might not know them), but also helpful (because they speed up your typing).  

By using Alfred Snippets with a bunch of stored acronyms as keywords, you can get the best of both worlds! 

In this repo, you will find: 

#### General Acronyms

Some general purpose acronyms, available for direct download as [General_Acronyms.alfredsnippets](./General_Acronyms.alfredsnippets)

Here is a sample screenshot (not meant as an up-to-date version of what acronyms are actually included):
